        Every year, millions of people around the globe come together to celebrate Earth Hour—a simple yet
        powerful act of turning off our lights for one hour to raise awareness about climate change and
        environmental conservation. Originating in 2007, Earth Hour has grown from a small, local initiative into
        a worldwide movement that unites communities, businesses, and governments in a common
        commitment to our planet.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Why Celebrate Earth Hour?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Raise Awareness:</b> Earth Hour isn’t just about saving energy for one hour; it’s a symbol of our collective responsibility to protect the environment. By turning off our lights, we shine a light on the urgent need to reduce energy consumption and transition to cleaner, sustainable energy sources.</li>
        <li><b>Community Unity:</b> When cities, landmarks, and households around the world switch off their lights simultaneously, it creates a powerful visual reminder of the importance of working together. This shared experience fosters a sense of global unity and encourages communities to take local action.</li>
        <li><b>A Step Toward Sustainability:</b> Earth Hour isn’t just about saving energy for one hour; it’s a symbol of our collective responsibility to protect the environment. By turning off our lights, we shine a light on the urgent need to reduce energy consumption and transition to cleaner, sustainable energy sources. Celebrating Earth Hour serves as a catalyst for long-term change. It’s an opportunity for individuals and businesses to rethink their energy habits, invest in renewable energy, and embrace sustainable practices that contribute to a healthier planet.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>How to Participate</h3>
      <p>Participation in Earth Hour is simple—just switch off non-essential lights and electrical devices for one hour, usually starting at 8:30 PM local time on the last Saturday of March. Many cities and organizations take it a step further by organizing local events, outdoor gatherings, and public displays to celebrate this moment of darkness and solidarity.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Beyond the Lights</h3>
      <p>While the hour of darkness is a powerful statement, the real goal is to inspire lasting change. Earth Hour encourages us to reflect on our environmental footprint and consider what steps we can take every day—whether that’s reducing energy use, supporting renewable energy projects, or advocating for policies that protect our natural resources.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Join the global movement by celebrating Earth Hour every year, and use this time as a springboard for sustainable action all year round.</p>
